[1] find 2 data sources that have some field in common

[2] get data as CSV files

[3]  think through the ultimate design of your SQL database tables.

	[a]  date   max    min   Precip  (new  key ID)

	[b]  incident number ==> new key ID  Incident_Type=>key  Occured_date_tim     Officer ID  Subject_Race   Subject_Gender

	[c]  key  Incident_Type

[4] import each into PIG 
  - clean data for unusable rows
  - remove unneeded columns
  - make any other needed data transformations (esp dates)
  - run as many pig jobs as needed to create unique outputs, one for each desired SQL table

working on one, testing load  using DESCRIBE
Aset: {oldID: chararray,ID: int,level: chararray,date: chararray,precinct: chararray,sector: chararray,beat: chararray,officerID: int,subjectID: int,race: chararray,gender: chararray}

Bset: {ID: int,level: chararray,date: chararray,officerID: int,subjectID: int,race: chararray,gender: chararray}

used CASE statement to generate secondary key

ID, officerID, subjectID, race, gender, date,    level   (1,2,3)

 date, max, min, precip, newsnow;

make sure to get rid of any row with what will be a duplicate key in your SQL or any column with a blank field.



[5] SSIS 
  - build SQL DB and empty tables
  - convert csv file to Excel 97-2003  workbook  (note, have added first row with names)
  - import the CSV files into the appropriate tables
  - (had a few snow fields empty, plugge to 0 in xls, 
  - imported incidents  clicked allow identity insert

[6] write ASP API app 
     build EF over new db
     do queries on table.
