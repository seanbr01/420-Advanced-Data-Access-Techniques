To have the node server return whatever html, js, css, files you want ...
use the res.sendFile(  
in the route.js file.  Have it return an html file, which in turns pulls whatever JS and css files it needs.








another way that seems to be better for just a little bit of html

Just add a dot to the end of line to start submitting pure html.
If that does the trick for you then try:

doctype html              
html. // THAT DOT
    <body>     
        <div>Hello, yes this is dog</div>
    </body>
