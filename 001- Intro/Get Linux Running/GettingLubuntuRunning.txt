To install on your home computer:
Go to this web site:    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
and download and install Virtual Box for your computer type.
After than is done, go to the same site and download and install its MATCHING version extensions,  VirtualBox Extension Pack.  Now you have a VM hosting environment at home.

Now for both home and the school computer, you need an operating system to install.

To get the Linux we are going to use, go here and download the VM image

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZBOWjo_t7mqsOHifXLdFN3BrAPUZRt88


2020 winter version  (Prog 209)

That is a huge file, like about 6 gigabytes, and will take a few minutes. It will likely show up in your Download folder as a xxxxxx.OVA file.  When it is done, just double click on it, and it will install itself onto your Virtual Box Host.

When it is done, start up the Virtual Box manager, click on the VM, and tell it to start.

Two super important things you must do to prevent corrupting your Linux and having
to start all over again:
1) DO NOT try and change the window size the this Linux starts out with.  We will cover 
how to safely do this later.  
2) Always shut down your Linux before leaving the class room or turning off your home
computer.

After you start it up, you can log into a pre-exiting account called bcuser
the password is the same bcuser (later, when you want to do privileged operations,
you will use a command called sudo, and it needs that same password).

Lastly, make one change for git:
enter this command to edit the git config file
  >>  git config --global -e

using arrow keys, find my name and password for github, and edit those 2 strings to by your GitHub sign-in

type in  
 >> cntl O  

then just hit Enter key  (to accept the file name to be writtenenter

then type 
  >>  cntl X
