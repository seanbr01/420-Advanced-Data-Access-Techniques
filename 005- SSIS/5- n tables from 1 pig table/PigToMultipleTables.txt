take raw PIG data

using selected subsets of rows, create 2 or more spreadsheets, one for each table.
sort by key, and remove duplicates in the "dimension" spreadsheets.

Set appropriate column to be primary key (click on the little yellow key icon), do not tell SQL to autogenerate key.

Use SSMS, create new Database, and new tables for each spreadsheet.
create a table diagram and set up the PK FK relationships

import each XLS into each table (I removed the header, top row, in my spreadsheets first)

Do the "dimension tables" first, as they can be created with no referential integrity issues.

Lastly, do your "data" table, which will have forign keys that must exist in the other tables.
