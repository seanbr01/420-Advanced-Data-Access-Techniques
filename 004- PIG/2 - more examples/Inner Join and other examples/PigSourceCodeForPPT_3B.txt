WORDCOUNT

A = load './input.txt';
B = foreach A generate flatten(TOKENIZE((chararray)$0)) as word;
C = group B by word;
D = foreach C generate COUNT(B), group;
store D into './wordcount';/* 

=======================================
Book Join

A = LOAD ‘KingJamesBible.txt'; 
B = FOREACH A GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE((chararray)$0)) AS word; 
C = FILTER B BY word MATCHES '\\w+'; 
D = GROUP C BY word; 
E = FOREACH D GENERATE COUNT(C), group; 
STORE E INTO 'bible_freq';

Do same thing for RomeoAndJuliet.txt, store into romeo_freq

bard = LOAD ‘romeo_freq’ AS (freq, word); 
kjv = LOAD ‘bible_freq’ AS (freq, word); 
inboth = JOIN bard BY word, kjv BY word; 
DUMP inboth
